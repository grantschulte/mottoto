# Easy-Beezy Use Case
This app runs off data from your the browser location.

It looks for a URL with this format:
/#/author/:author/motto/:motto

Replace `:author` with a valid url encoded author name string and `:motto` with a valid url encoded motto string.

Try this example:
[http://localhost:8000/App.elm/#/author/alex/motto/Keep%20it%20right,%20keep%20it%20tight.](http://localhost:8000/App.elm/#/author/alex/motto/Keep%20it%20right,%20keep%20it%20tight.)

# Also...
Keep it right, keep it tight.
